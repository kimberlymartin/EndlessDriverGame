# Endless Driver Game

This is a game made by a team of me and some fellow classmates that is inspired by endless runner games such as Temple Run and Subway Surfer. The user controls a car and must steer between three lanes in order to avoid barrels and collect as many coins as they can. The game includes a tutorial mode, sandbox mode, and options for users to choose their difficulty and sensitivity.
